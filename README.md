# Matching Game Project README

## Introduction
Welcome to the Matching Game Project! This project is a React.js application developed with TypeScript, aimed at providing an engaging and challenging matching game experience. Players will test their memory and skills by matching items within a specified number of tries. Upon successful matches, players will collect bananas, prominently displayed on the final screen as a testament to their success.

## Features
- Engaging Matching Game: Players can enjoy a fun and interactive matching game experience.
- Memory Testing: Test your memory and skills by matching items within a defined number of tries.
- Dynamic Data Integration: Data for the game can be dynamically sourced from either a JSON file or a database, providing flexibility and scalability.
- TypeScript Integration: Utilizes TypeScript to define data structures, ensuring type safety and proper integration of key fields.

## How to Play
1. Upon launching the game, players will be presented with a grid of cards, each containing hidden items.
2. Players can flip two cards at a time to reveal the hidden items.
3. The objective is to match pairs of identical items within the specified number of tries.
4. Upon successful matches, players will collect bananas, displayed prominently on the final screen.
